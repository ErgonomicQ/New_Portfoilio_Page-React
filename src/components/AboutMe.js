                        Hi! Nice to meet you! My name is Cody, and I am an aspiring junior full-stack web dev will a passon for learning
                    and have entered this field hoping every day beings a new challenge to solve. I am an avid reader, with hobbies in model building
                    and collection, so I'm very much about the process rather than result. I am a homebody for the most part, choosing to live a 
                    quiet calm life, but that doesn't mean I'm not social. I like talking to others, learning new things from their experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you're interested in contacting me, please feel free to reach out to me via the Contact section. I look forward to hearing from you!
                    </p>
